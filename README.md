# Step 1:

Average across 5 runs:
  Total time: 6550.600 ms
  Average time per tick: 32.753 ms
  Ticks per second: 30.533

# Step 2:
After parallelizing external forces, it becomes worse:

Average across 5 runs:
  Total time: 6758.000 ms
  Average time per tick: 33.790 ms
  Ticks per second: 29.608

# Step 3: After parallelizing pressure forces, again worse:

Average across 5 runs:
  Total time: 6774.400 ms
  Average time per tick: 33.872 ms
  Ticks per second: 29.575

# Step 4: After parallelizing kinetic energy, slightly better:

Average across 5 runs:
  Total time: 6450.800 ms
  Average time per tick: 32.254 ms
  Ticks per second: 31.013
